# University-Of-Michigan-Python-Data-Structures

This course will introduce the core data structures of the Python programming language. We will move past the basics of procedural programming and explore how we can use the Python built-in data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples to perform increasingly complex data analysis. 


This course consists of few Grades Assignments for each Chapter per week which i would like to share with you all.
